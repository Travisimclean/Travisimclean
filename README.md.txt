Timclean@my.waketech.edu

My github account is Travisimclean and I created it to upload my website for school.

The repository I created is to put my website folder into it and upload it to make my website public so everyone can now view it.

To be able to clone the repository i just created i went to the file location of the one i jsut made it copied the folder and then went into the location of the desktop version and then pasted them into there.
